# Ballroom Blitz Wiki  
Success! You’ve infiltrated the coronation ball for the new King Azimuth in order to stage a coup and install yourself as monarch. Problem is, everyone else had roughly the same idea. Suddenly, someone in the back said “Everyone, attack!” and now it turned into a ballroom blitz! You (and everybody else it seems) figure that if you can hold the center of the room the longest, you can successfully claim the throne.

## Overview and Objectives  
Ballroom Blitz is a free for all, “King of the Hill” game. The goal is to earn as many points as possible before the game ends. Earn points through controlling the center and defeating others. There will be 4 players in a game and only one winner.

MechMania 28 will be a Swiss-system tournament.  
   


---

Each turn consists of four phases in the following order:
#### 1. Use Phase
Players can use any items they may be holding  
#### 2. Movement Phase
Players may do one of the following actions:
- Move to a tile
- Teleport back to the player's spawn point
#### 3. Attack Phase:
Players may do one of the following actions:
- Attack one other player of their choice who is within range
#### 4. Buy Phase:
If at their spawn point, players can choose to buy an item. As a player can only hold one item at a time, buying an item will remove any item the player was holding beforehand.   

---

- If a player is standing on their spawn point by the end of a turn, they will automatically heal to full health.  
   
- If two players move to the same tile, they will both be in that tile.

- When a player’s health drops to zero, they die and respawn at their spawn point. A player will lose their currently held item upon death.

## The Ballroom 
The place you make history is the ballroom at the royal palace. The map is a square grid of 10x10 tiles. In the middle is the control point. At the four corners are the doors (spawn points) to the banquet hall.

## The Control Point 
The control point is a 2x2 set of control tiles in the middle of the ballroom. When a player ends a turn in one of the control tiles, they earn 2 points towards their score. Multiple players are allowed on the control tiles, but do you _really_ trust them?

## Endgame
Players earn points in two ways:
- 2 Points for ending a turn on the control point
- 1 Point for dealing fatal damage to another player  
   
The game ends in **100** turns. At the end of the game, the victor is decided by whomever holds the most points. If there is a tie between 2 or more players, the one who holds the most gold wins. If there is a tie in gold, the winner shall be decided by a coin flip.  

## Classes
Each class plays to a different style to dominate the Ballroom. There are 4 different stats for a class.  
   Range uses Chebyshev distance.  
> D<sub>Chebyshev</sub> = max( |x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>|, |y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>| )  
 
While Speed uses Manhattan Distance.
   > D<sub>Manhattan</sub> = |x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>| + |y<sub>2</sub> - y<sub>1</sub>|
 
- Health: The amount of damage a player can sustain
- Damage: The amount of damage a player's attack deals, 1 damage = 1 health  
- Speed: The distance a player can move in a single turn  
- Range: The distance a player's attack can reach

- At the end of every turn, all players automatically earn 1 gold.
