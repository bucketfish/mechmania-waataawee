This is the link to a web based version of the visualizer

The visualizer is how you will convert the JSONs produced by your bots and the engine into something more easily interpretable by you. You don't have to use it, but you would probably be making this competition significantly harder for yourself if you don't. So please, familiarize yourself with the basic guidelines.

## The Labelled Basics
<img width="646" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90988235/193191780-2047efa5-f0fd-49fe-827c-deb081498e79.png">
When you first open the visualizer, it will look something like this. Just click the center button which is labelled "Upload file" to upload your gamelog.
If your gamelog is valid, after a brief loading period, you will see something like this:

**Important parts labelled:**
1. This is the name of the bot displayed in the panel.
2. This is the bot in the corresponding colored panel.
3. From left to right, these icons display the bots' coins, attack, range, and speed.
4. This is where held items will be. Note that permanent items will give their bonus while held in this slot.
5. This is where temporary items that have been used previously and are currently in effect are displayed. While under the effect of a temporary item, this area will also display how many turns the effect has left. Note that shields are a special case, and will not be displayed in this section even when active.
6. This is the turn counter.
7. Drag along this timeline to look at a different point in time.
